### About me:

 I'm a backend python developer with 5+ years of experience. Before programming, i worked in the field of advertising for 3 years, analyzed a large amount of information and worked with metrics.<img src="https://media .giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30px">. <br><br>One of the last areas of my work is the creation of bots and parsers. I have developed several Telegram bots that support more than 500 thousand users. These projects implement complex interaction scenarios, integration with various external services, and provide high-load operation. In addition, I have created a parser that collects information about all users, groups and channels in VKontakte and Telegram for the analytics and advertising service.<br><br>I also developed an asynchronous chat with end-to-end encryption, where I used PyQt5 for the frontend and asynchronous Python technologies for the backend. In addition to this, I have created an online bodybuilding training service with the integration of artificial intelligence on Django, in which I have developed both a frontend and a backend.<br><br>My experience covers a wide range of technologies and tasks, including creating websites on Django, Flask and FastAPI, writing parsers using Scrapy, Selenium and BeautifulSoup, as well as developing telegram bots with Telethon and Aiogram. I am able to implement neural networks and work with various APIs, keep projects running and add new functions. In my projects, I also write integration and unit tests to ensure code quality.<br><br>As a hobby, I administer programming projects. I want to continue to develop my skills in this field and increase the scale of my projects.<br><br>You can view my project portfolio in the pinned section below or go to my repositories for a more detailed study ‚û°Ô∏è https://github.com/biter-bit?tab=repositories.
